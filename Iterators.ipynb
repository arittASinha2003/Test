If there are no more items to return, it raises the `StopIteration` exception.\n","\n","## Creating Iterators\n","\n","In Python, we can create iterators for any iterable objects such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.\n","\n","## Use Cases\n","\n","- Iterators are powerful tools when dealing with large stream of data.\n","- If we use regular list to store values, the computer would run out of memory quickly.\n","- With iterators, we can save resources as they return only one element at a time, meaning we can deal with infinite data in finite memory.\n","- Iterators are implemented in Python using Generators.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jexCawuQsh4h"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Examples\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xotNQzPmG3sE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Example 1: Iterating Over a String\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8wY8ffpl1K0t"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Creating an iterator for a string\n","string1 = \"Hi, AR\"\n","iter1 = iter(string1)\n","\n","# Accessing elements using next()\n","print(next(iter1))\n","print(next(iter1))\n","print(next(iter1))\n","print(next(iter1))\n","print(next(iter1))\n","print(next(iter1))\n","# print(next(iter1)) #
